# CodeClause-Spam-Classifier-Project
Hello, this is the Spam Classifier Project using Python. I got this project under the internshp of CodeClause. I'm an Artificial Intelligence Intern at CodeClause.
Spam classification is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) where the goal is to automatically determine whether a given piece of text (e.g., email, message) is spam or not. We used scikit-learn library, which provides a range of machine learning algorithms and tools for text classification tasks.
