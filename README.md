# CodeClause-Spam-Classifier-Project
Hello, this is the Spam Classifier Project using Python. I got this project under the internshp of CodeClause. I'm an Artificial Intelligence Intern at CodeClause.
Basically this project will tell you whether the entered mail is 'Spam' or 'Ham'. Several predictions have been made in this
project that will be able to determine the status of the entered words
